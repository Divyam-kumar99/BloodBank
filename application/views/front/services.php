                <h3>About Blood Donation</h3>
                    <p> Each day, thousands of people need donated blood and blood products to keep them in good health or allow them to stay alive.
                    If a personâ€™s blood levels fall due to an accident or illness, or if their blood is not functioning properly, there will not be enough oxygen or other nutrients to maintain their vital organs.
                    Donating whole blood can help these people.A similar process to whole blood donation is apheresis. 
                    This provides other blood components, such as platelets. A donation of platelets can help people who have issues related to clotting. 
                    It may also provide antibodies to help fight a disease, such as COVID-19. 
                    Giving blood can be a life saving action, but it may also have benefits for the donor.
                    </p>
